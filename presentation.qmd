## Intro: the `pell` data set.

-   Contains information on Pell Grant awards to U.S. college students from 1999-2017

-   Compilation of yearly data sets collected by U.S. Department of Education

-   6 columns: State, Award, Recipient, Name, Session, Year

## Our Research Question + Goal

-   Goal is to understand how average Pell grant award varies across different regions throughout time
-   Goal is to understand which states have seen greatest changes in proportion of students receiving Pell grants over 1997 to 2017.

# Question 1:

## How does the average Pell grant award change over time based on the geographic region?

-   Created two additional variables: **average pell grant** per school and **region**.

-   **Spatial** **graph** showing average pell grant award across presidential terms for individual states in U.S.

-   **Line** **graph** which explores time series progression of pell grant awards by region.

## Visualization \# 1

```{r}
#visualization # 1
ggplot(pell_map, aes(long, lat, group = group)) + 
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = AVG_PELL_AWARD), color = "white") + 
  facet_wrap(~TERM) +
  scale_fill_continuous(name = "Average Pell Grant Size")
  labs(fill = "Average Award ($)",
       title = "Consistent State-by-State Upward Trend Across Presidencies")
```

## Key Takeaways

-   Not much variation across states

-   Sharp increase in average award over time

-   Tuition increasing and inflation.

## Visualization \# 2

```{r}
#visualization # 1
ggplot(pell_grouped2, aes(x = YEAR, y = AVG_PELL_AWARD,
                          group = REGION, color = REGION)) + 
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = wes_palette("Moonrise2", n = 4)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 2000, to = 2018, by = 4)) +
  labs(title = "Upward Trend in Average Pell Grant", 
       subtitle = "Grouped by Region", 
       x = "Year", 
       y = "Average Pell Award ($)")
```

## Key Takeaways #2

-   Northeast has highest average award, while Midwest has lowest.

-   Consistent trend across regions

-   Pell grant is federal financial aid.

# Question 2:

## How does the average Pell grant award change over time based on the geographic region?

## Plots

```{r}
#| label: recode-species
#| echo: false

# In this chunk I'm doing a bunch of analysis that I don't want to present 
# in my slides. But I need the resulting data frame for a plot I want to present.

penguins_modified <- penguins %>%
  mutate(species = fct_other(species, keep = "Adelie"))
```

```{r}
#| label: plot-penguins
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-alt: |
#|   Body mass vs. flipper lenght of Palmer Penguins for species Adelie and all 
#|   the others combined together. There is a relatively strong, positive 
#|   relationship between the two variables. The Adelie penguins are clustered 
#|   together but they don't exhibit a different trend than the rest of the 
#|   penguins.

# Uses modified penguins dataset from previous chunk
# Play around with height and width until you're happy with the look

ggplot(
  penguins_modified, 
  aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)
  ) +
  geom_point() + 
  theme_minimal()
```

## Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r}
#| label: penguins-table

gt(head(penguins))
```

## Math Expressions {.smaller}

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. \$\alpha+\beta\$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

    $$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1.  The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

2.  There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

# Wrap up

## Feeling adventurous?

-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. Some solutions for this can be found at https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs.
