## Intro: the `pell` data set.

-   Contains information on Pell Grant awards to U.S. college students from 1999-2017

-   Compilation of yearly data sets collected by U.S. Department of Education

-   6 columns: Name, State, Total Award, Year, Recipients, Session

## Our Research Question + Goal

-   Goal is to understand average Pell grant award distribution over time, explore reasoning for these patterns, and learn how this relates to higher education.

# Question 1:

## How does the average Pell grant award change over time based on the geographic region?

-   Created two additional variables: **average pell grant** per school and **region**.

-   **Spatial** **graph** showing average pell grant award across presidential terms for individual states in U.S.

-   **Line** **graph** which explores time series progression of pell grant awards by region.

## Visualization \# 1

```{r}
#visualization # 1
ggplot(pell_map, aes(long, lat, group = group)) + 
   geom_polygon(aes(fill = AVG_PELL_AWARD), color = "white") +
   scale_fill_gradient(low = "light green", high = "dark green") +
   facet_wrap(~TERM) +
   labs(fill = "Average Award ($)",
        title = "Consistent State-by-State Upward Trend Across Presidencies")
```

## Visualization \# 2

```{r}
#visualization # 1

                           group = REGION, color = REGION)) +

        subtitle = "Grouped by Region", 
        x = "Year", 
       y = "Average Pell Award ($)")
```

# Question 2:

## How does the average Pell grant award change over time based on the geographic region?

-   Which states have seen greatest changes in their proportion of students receiving awards over time.

-   Created the **proportion_recieving_pell** variable

## Visualization \# 1
